## Two scripts that will let you hear your jello scream as you eat it. 

Materials needed:
- Adafruit 12-Key Capacitive Touch Sensor Breakout - MPR121
- Arduino
- computer running a Processing script

Load the Arduino script onto your Arduino, connect the MPR121 breakout board to the Arduino. 
Attach a single wire to one of the breakout board pins. Attach the other end of the wire to 
a metal spoon so that it will touch the jello when you try to eat it. 


Connect the Arduino to your computer and run the Processing script. The Arduino will communicate 
with Processing over Serial. Turn up the volume and hear your jello scream.


The deeper the spoon goes into the jello, the higher pitched the screaming.
